 A program to find solutions to the problem of converting a starting colour in the k-bit colour format to a LEGAL colour using the following 6 search strategies: BFS, DFS, IDS, 
 Greedy, A*, and Hill-climbing. Here, k can be any integer from 3 to 12 inclusive. Using the smallest Hamming distance from any LEGAL colour for the heuristic in Greedy and A* search, 
 and as an evaluation function in hill-climbing algorithms.
